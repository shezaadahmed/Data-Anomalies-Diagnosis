# Project Description: 
The goal of this project is to develop a Python script that detects anomalies in a continuous data stream, simulating floating-point numbers. This data could represent metrics such as financial transactions or system metrics, with a focus on identifying unusual patterns. This project also deeply focuses on developing a robust Python script capable of detecting anomalies in real-time data streams, which can be critical for applications such as financial monitoring and
system performance analysis.

# Real-Time Visualization:
Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection is crucial for real-time applications where rapid identification of unusual patterns is essential for operational integrity and decision-making. In cybersecurity, it helps detect potential threats such as intrusions or DDoS attacks by analyzing network traffic in real time. <br>
In financial systems, it monitors transaction streams to flag fraudulent behavior instantly. Industries like healthcare and manufacturing use it to track live sensor data, enabling early warnings for patient health anomalies or equipment failures. Additionally, smart city infrastructure benefits from it by analyzing traffic, energy usage, or public safety data for immediate response. These systems typically use real-time stream processing frameworks like Apache Kafka or Spark Streaming combined with lightweight machine learning models to ensure low-latency, scalable, and accurate anomaly detection across high-velocity data streams.In dynamic environments such as cybersecurity, it enables the continuous monitoring of network logs and user behavior to instantly detect intrusions, malware activity, or unusual access patterns, thereby minimizing breach impact.
