# Project Description: 
The goal of this project is to develop a Python script that detects anomalies in a continuous data stream, simulating floating-point numbers. This data could represent metrics such as financial transactions or system metrics, with a focus on identifying unusual patterns. This project also deeply focuses on developing a robust Python script capable of detecting anomalies in real-time data streams, which can be critical for applications such as financial monitoring and
system performance analysis.
# Chosen Algorithms:
1). Statistical Methods: Z-Score
2). Machine Learning: K-Means Clustering, Isolation Forest
3). Neural Networks: Autoencoders, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNâ€™s)
4). Time Series Analysis: Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series
5). Ensemble Methods: Random Cut Forest.
# Effectiveness:
1). **Real-Time Detection**: It enables immediate anomaly detection as data is
processed. <br>
2). **Immediate Results**: Anomalies are detected on-the-fly, allowing for quick
responses to potential issues.
3). **User-Friendly**: The threshold concept is intuitive, making it accessible for users
with varying technical backgrounds.
4). **Simplicity**: This algorithm is easy to implement and runs efficiently in real-time
applications.
